Nice to meet you here ! 

I am Liangtian He, currently an Associate Professor and a Master's Supervisor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Anhui University (安徽大学). My research interests lie at the intersection of Image Processing and Computer Vision, with a focus on developing robust algorithms for real-world applications. I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2018, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professors Zhaoyin Xiang and Yilun Wang. 

I am actively recruiting highly motivated Master's students to join my research group. If you have a solid foundation in mathematics and programming, and are passionate about exploring the frontiers of image processing and computer vision, I strongly encourage you to apply. Interested candidates are welcome to send their CV and a brief statement of interest to my email: helt[at]ahu[dot]edu[dot]cn. Please feel free to reach out in advance to discuss potential research projects.
